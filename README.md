## Problem Statement

The retail industry, particularly e-commerce, is experiencing exponential growth, leading to an unprecedented volume of sales data. Amidst this vast amount of information, companies like Amazon face the challenge of extracting meaningful insights to drive strategic decisions and maintain a competitive edge in the market. However, the sheer complexity and size of the data often hinder effective analysis and decision-making processes.

To address this challenge, our project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of Amazon's sales data from 2012 to 2015 using Power BI.
